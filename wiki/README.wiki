Wifite is a python script which automates the WEP and WPA cracking process with aircrack-ng tools.

_Please Note: *Wifite can and will delete certain existing .CAP and .XOR files inside of the directory it is run*; specifically any `*`.XOR files and replay-`*`.cap files. Please move wifite.py into its own directory to avoid the deleting of these kinds of files._

Wifite requires:

* A Linux operating system
  * I highly recommend using the [http://www.backtrack-linux.org/downloads/ Backtrack4 R1] flavor of Ubuntu. It already contains many tools required by wifite, and wifite was developed on this platform.
  * Other recommended distributions of linux include ArchLinux, Auditor, and Bauer-Puntu.
* Wireless drivers patched for injection and monitor mode,
  * To find out if there exist linux drivers for your wireless chipset, [http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers see this aircrack-ng site]
  * Sometimes the easiest thing to do is buy a new wireless card that already has drivers available.
* The aircrack-ng suite of tools
  * v1.1 is PREFERRED
  * you need at LEAST v1.0-rc4, but please upgrade to the latest v1.1
* Python 2.4.5 or 2.5.2
  * other versions may work, but these are the only confirmed working versions
